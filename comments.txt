DONE

Translated models and add unique names to the fields so they won't be miss recognized

Validate patient form:
    This might require to get a list of inputs with more than the ones from the patient form

Finish Backend:
    create patient   GET POST redirect user to patient list page
    update patient   GET POST
    list patient     GET

Front for patient list

display submit button after fetch

Submit button should execute a function which validates all fields to be sent
so the form wont be rejected. If one of them isn't valid it should point the 
user to that specific section and highlight the invalid input.

Finish evolution section and go on to tests

OTHER


submitting fetch forms:

The submitting function will check the specific fields. If they are valid, they 
will be sumbitted. Otherwise, the first invalid related input will be highlighted


Submitting Evolution

There is only one field so it shouldn't be forgotten, therefore the required attribute 
could be removed


Submitting patient form

Since this would be the last action, once the specific fields are validated, the 
required attribute should be removed from all the other fields to allow the form to be 
submitted





function validateInputs('form-tag-class') {

}

get list of specific inputs

check for an invalid input to execute the alert function over it

    alert function:

    select the message to be displayed  <---

    add and remove classes to take the user to that specific section  <---

    display message over the invalid input

if not invalid input:

    remove required attribute ---> not always 

    submit --> break

    

In the backend I shouldn't take in to account fetch forms
